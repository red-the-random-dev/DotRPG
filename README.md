# DotRPG
A game engine for creation of jRPGs and visual novels based on MonoGame.

## Things implemented so far
+ Text display and scrolling
+ Sprite display and animation assistance
+ Timed event firing
+ Rigid body collision physics (see \_Example and Objects/Dynamics projects)

## DotRPG uses
+ [**MonoGame**](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) -- an open source XNA framework successor. This engine heavily relies on MonoGame's constructions.

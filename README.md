# DotRPG
A game engine for creation of jRPGs and visual novels based on MonoGame.

## Things implemented so far (week 8 day 4)
+ User interface elements such as text boxes and progress bars
+ User interface rendering in TopDownFrames (see Testroom_00 and TestRoomScript)
+ Sprite display and animation assistance
+ Embedded scripting engine, which supports Lua and pre-built C# modules
+ Rigid body collision physics (see \_Example and Objects/Dynamics projects)
+ Timed event firing
+ Color channels and control of them (see Behavior/Management and \_Example/DialogComp.cs)
+ Default behavior for top-down maps (see Behavior/Defaults)

## DotRPG uses
+ [**MonoGame**](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) -- an open source XNA framework successor. This engine heavily relies on MonoGame's constructions.
+ [**NLua**](https://github.com/NLua/NLua) -- Embedded Lua runtime.
